# squeekboard-dvp
Basic Programmer-Dvorak-lite layout for Squeekboard
Confirmed working on PinePhone running PostMarketOS and Mobian versions of Phosh, but probably works anywhere

# Installation
Just save us+dvp.yaml in ~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/
If this doesnt instantly fix your layout, click the globe icon on squeekboard and toggle it to terminal and back to dvorak. Doesn't require reboot.
