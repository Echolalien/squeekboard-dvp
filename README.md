# squeekboard-dvp
Basic Programmer-Dvorak-lite layout for Squeekboard
Confirmed working on PinePhone running PostMarketOS and Phosh, but probably works anywhere

# Installation
Just save this file in ~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/ as terminal.yaml
Click the globe icon on your keyboard, and change to Terminal. If it was already Terminal you might need to change to something else and back to load correctly. Doesn't require reboot.
